## Description

This script decrypts data that has been encrypted using the DES algorithm. It includes the necessary tables and functions to perform DES decryption. DES uses a symmetric key, so you should have the same key that was used for encryption.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `bitarray` Python library (Install it using `pip install bitarray`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. Install the `bitarray` library if you haven't already:
   
   ```bash
   pip install bitarray
